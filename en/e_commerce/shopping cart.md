## Shopping Cart

In addition to listing products, ERPNext also allows selling them via the Shopping Cart.

To enable Shopping Cart, go to:

> E Commerce Settings > [Shopping Cart](https://docs.erpnext.com/docs/v13/user/manual/en/e_commerce_settings#shopping-cart)

You can even build a **landing page** for your store at a custom route (eg. /_store_). [Learn More](https://docs.erpnext.com/docs/v13/user/manual/en/website/store-landing-page).

## 1\. Item Types

Shopping Cart works differently for Items with and without variants.

### 1.1 Items without variants

Items without variants have their dedicated product page and an **Add to Cart** button.

### 1.2 Items with variants

Since Item Templates can't be bought directly, there is a Configure button to choose the specific variant and add it to cart.

## 2\. Cart Quotation

If checkout is disabled, when your customers add an item to cart, they can click on the **Request for Quotation** button to get a quote for it. A [Quotation](https://docs.erpnext.com/docs/v13/user/manual/en/selling/quotation) is generated in the system.

## 3\. Cart Checkout

You can enable checkout from the [Checkout Settings](https://docs.erpnext.com/docs/v13/user/manual/en/e_commerce/e_commerce_settings#checkout-settings) section in **E Commerce Settings**.
