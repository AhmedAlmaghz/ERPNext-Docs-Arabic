ERPNext allows users to add colours to certain documents for better visual cues and representation. A good example of this would be the [Event Calendar](https://docs.erpnext.com/docs/v13/user/manual/en/using-erpnext/calendar), where, for each event you can add a colour.

We will be doing so by customizing [Tasks](https://docs.erpnext.com/docs/v13/user/manual/en/projects/tasks) under Projects module.

## Steps To Add Colours To The Gantt Chart

1.  Go to [Customize Form](https://docs.erpnext.com/docs/v13/user/manual/en/customize-erpnext/customize-form) in the system and select _Task_ in _Enter Form Type_ option. Alternatively, you can reach this screen by going to **Menu > Customize** from the Task list or form.
