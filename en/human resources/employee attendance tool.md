**Employee Attendance Tool allows you to mark the attendance of multiple employees for a particular date.**

To access the Employee Attendance Tool, go to:

This tool allows you to add attendance records for multiple employees based on their Department and Branch for a given day quickly.

## 1\. Prerequisites

Before creating an Employee Attendance, it is advised that you create the following first:

*   [Employee](https://docs.erpnext.com/docs/v14/user/manual/en/human-resources/employee)
    
*   [Department](https://docs.erpnext.com/docs/v14/user/manual/en/human-resources/department)
    
*   [Branch](https://docs.erpnext.com/docs/v14/user/manual/en/human-resources/branch)
    

1.  Enter the Date.
    
2.  Select the Department and Branch (optional).
    
3.  Select the Employees.
    
4.  Mark Present, Absent, or Half Day as required.
    
5.  You can also select the shift and mark employees with Late Entry and Early Exit from this view.
    
6.  The Marked Attendance table below the tool will show you all the employees you have marked attendance for along with their attendance status. You can use column filters to search for a particular employee or employees with a particular status form this table.
