## Introduction

The Stock or Inventory module in ERPNext helps you to:

*   Maintain details of your products and warehouses.
*   Track receipt, transfer and delivery of the products.
*   Optimize stock levels by providing real-time information via reports.
*   Provide valuation of each product.

The Stock module is tightly integrated with Purchase, Manufacturing and Accounting modules.
