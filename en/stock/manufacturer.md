## Manufacturer

**A manufacturer created or produces an Item.**

A Manufacturer may not be the same person/company that sells the Item under a specific [Brand](https://docs.erpnext.com/docs/v13/user/manual/en/selling/brand). For example, Unico Plastics can be the Manufacturer of plastic brushes but it may be sold under a Brand, say, Super Brushes.

In ERPNext, a Manufacturer can be used to identify Items using a specific part number.

To access the Manufacturer list, go to:
