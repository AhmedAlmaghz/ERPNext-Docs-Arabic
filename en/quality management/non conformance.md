## Non Conformance

> Introduced in Version 13

_A Non Conformance is a observation that can be filed by any person in the organization to note non compliance to a specific procedure_

Once Quality Procedures are defined, the goal of a quality focussed organization is to ensure that they hare followed. This ensures consistent quality and parameters as per the customer's expectation. If these procedures are not followed, an observation is recorded via a _Non Conformance_ or called NC in quality systems.

In ERPNext, you can create a Non Conformance by selecting the Quality Procedure against which it was observed, maintain its status and record corrective and preventive actions
