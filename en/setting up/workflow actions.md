## Workflow Actions

> Introduced in Version 11

**Workflow Actions is a single place to manage all the pending actions you can take on Workflows.**

Workflow Actions will send email notifications only if the 'Send Email Alert' checkbox is ticked in the Workflow that you've created.

To access Workflow Actions, go to:

> Home > Settings > Workflow Actions

If a User is eligible to take action on some workflows, emails will be sent to the user with the relevant document as attachment. From there the user can `Approve` or `Reject` the Workflow.

Also the users will see entries in their Workflow Action list: ![Workflow Action List](https://docs.erpnext.com/files/workflow-actions-list.png)

**Note:**

*   You can set email template for Workflow Actions on each state. The template might consist of a message for users to proceed with the next Workflow Actions.
*   Workflow Actions will not be created for a transition to optional states.
